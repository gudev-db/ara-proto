Who made the report?
The reports about the working conditions at Jinjiang Construction Brazil did not come from European or American automakers. 
According to a source from the state government of Bahia, which is directly involved with BYD, the Bahia Labor Public Prosecutor's Office (MPT-BA) started an investigation into the construction of the plant following complaints from residents of the city of Cama√ßari, where the plant is located. 
This source pointed out that the BYD plant is situated near the city center, in front of two important avenues, and residents frequently pass by the construction site.
Additionally, the source mentioned some dissatisfaction in the city regarding the hiring of Chinese workers at the plant, which might have contributed to the complaints.
The source said that both the state government and the Cama√ßari city hall had received complaints from residents about BYD‚Äôs hiring practices and those of its subcontractors; ‚Äúvarious positions require English, technical training in specific areas, and the local workforce doesn‚Äôt have these qualifications. So, even in positions where BYD and its subcontractors hire Brazilians, these positions often go to people from Salvador (the state capital).‚Äù 
The source also stated that the state government is promoting professional training courses for the city‚Äôs residents to prepare them for technical roles at the factory.
It was reported that even during the construction phase of the plant, most of the workers at BYD and its subcontractors are Brazilian. Once production begins, the state government expects that 80% of the workforce will be Brazilian. ‚ÄúThe Chinese workers at BYD will all be in technical roles or people who have been in Brazil for a while and will work under the CLT regime (CLT is the labor regime that governs employment relations in Brazil),‚Äù said the source, adding that this is why the state government believes ‚Äúthe population of the state and Cama√ßari will be very satisfied.‚Äù

State Government's Perception of the Case
The Bahia government source emphasized that there is ‚Äúvery good communication between the state government and BYD.‚Äù The source noted that Bahia‚Äôs governor, Jer√¥nimo Rodrigues, believes BYD responded very quickly to the accusations of forced labor, and that the state government‚Äôs main concern now is the project‚Äôs timeline.
BYD‚Äôs plant is one of the major job-generating projects for Bahia, and the governor highly values it because it generates ‚Äújobs and revenue for the state.‚Äù 
The source was clear that the state‚Äôs feeling regarding the case is that ‚ÄúBYD is committed to making the necessary adjustments, and now it‚Äôs time to move forward and start production.‚Äù
The state source stated that before the issue, the plan was for production to begin in March. BYD is now studying how much the schedule will be delayed, but production is expected to begin sometime in the second half of the year.
‚ÄúThe state government is closely monitoring this (the schedule changes),‚Äù the source said, adding that the state‚Äôs interest is to start the work as soon as possible.
When asked if there was any friction between the state government and BYD over this case, the source explained that ‚Äúthere was concern from the state government about the progress of the work and the case itself, but because BYD responded quickly and severed ties with Jinjiang, these concerns were resolved. From an institutional perspective, the relationship remained very good.‚Äù
Asked about the fine‚Äôs amount, the source said that neither the Labor Public Prosecutor's Office of Bahia (MPT-BA) nor BYD have discussed this with the state government, and that based on conversations with company representatives, the main concern is not the financial aspect, but the potential reputational damage to BYD due to the fine.
Federal Government‚Äôs Perception of the Case
When asked about the Lula government‚Äôs view of the Jinjiang case, one of the key international relations advisors for the Workers' Party (PT) and a China expert reported that ‚Äúduring Xi Jinping's visit last year, it was said that China and Brazil are in the best moment of their relationship, it is a period of closer ties. In any relationship, when there‚Äôs a closer connection, some friction arises, and you need to have conversations to understand each other better. This problem with Jinjiang is largely due to cultural differences, and we saw a genuine interest from BYD in better understanding how things work here.‚Äù
According to the PT advisor, ‚ÄúChinese companies coming to Brazil face a perception of risk problems. Many times because they have the support of the federal government and don‚Äôt understand Brazil‚Äôs political system and legislation, they think that with strong federal backing, they have great institutional security. In China, if you‚Äôre friends with Xi Jinping, he can make a call and resolve your issue, and they think it works the same way here.‚Äù
‚ÄúHere [in Brazil], there is independence of the institutions. The Chinese have a hard time understanding that the Brazilian political and decision-making system is very decentralized. Lula cannot call the Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office and say ‚Äòlook, the BYD factory is very important for Bahia, don‚Äôt create problems for them, or they might decide to invest less,‚Äô that doesn‚Äôt happen here,‚Äù said the advisor.
The advisor also pointed out that the PT leadership believes this case has helped Chinese companies develop a better understanding of how the Brazilian political system functions. ‚ÄúThere are rules that need to be followed, being friends with Lula won‚Äôt solve the problems.‚Äù 
The advisor emphasized that it‚Äôs common for Chinese companies in Brazil to disregard local laws, thinking they can resolve issues through Guanxi, even when repeatedly warned that this isn‚Äôt how things work in Brazil. 
Apart from these cultural and institutional differences, the advisor noted that despite the Brazilian government‚Äôs strong interest in attracting Chinese investment, there are criticisms within the government about the lack of multiplier effects from Chinese investments. There is a widespread criticism in the Brazilian public and private sector that when China invests abroad, the Chinese bring in their own raw materials and labor, which doesn‚Äôt create many jobs or generate significant revenue in the countries where the investments are made.
The advisor reported that for the BYD plant specifically, a significant presence of Brazilian workers was negotiated. ‚ÄúPresident Lula and Minister Rui Costa (former governor of Bahia, who negotiated the BYD factory in Cama√ßari) are pleased with the number of jobs the BYD factory will create in Bahia and the percentage of Brazilian workers once it‚Äôs fully operational, but it looks bad for a project that was announced as ‚Äòjob creation for Brazilians‚Äô to be known for importing Chinese labor under conditions similar to slavery.‚Äù

Institutions Responsible for Investigations
The main institution responsible for the investigation is the Bahia Labor Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office, as the plant is being constructed in that state.
It is important to note that the Brazilian judiciary is extremely powerful, and its representatives are often referred to as ‚Äúlords of power.‚Äù 
The Labor Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office has seen a decline in power since the labor reform of 2017, which reduced its authority. The Labor Public Prosecutor's Office of Bahia (MPT-BA) views this investigation as an opportunity to regain prominence.
Prosecutor Bernardo Guimar√£es is leading the investigation.
According to the head of Guimar√£es‚Äô office, the investigation is ongoing, and various government institutions are actively monitoring it, including the Labor Public Prosecutor's Office of Bahia (MPT-BA), the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MTE), and the Federal Police (PF). 
The Labor Public Prosecutor's Office of Bahia (MPT-BA) and the Federal Police (PF) have a high degree of autonomy from both the federal and state governments. 
The Federal Police (PF) has already investigated and even arrested President Lula in 2018. It‚Äôs impossible for Lula to call these institutions and request that they adopt a more favorable stance toward BYD or Jinjiang.

Possible Legal Consequences for BYD and Jinjiang
In communication with a senior official from the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MTE) regarding the case, she stated that ‚Äúthe investigation could conclude by the fifth month of its execution,‚Äù meaning it should wrap up by the end of April at the latest. 
The official said that Jinjiang will likely be included in the ‚ÄúList of Employers Who Have Subjugated Workers to Conditions Similar to Slavery,‚Äù which is published on the Ministry‚Äôs official website. This list, commonly known as the ‚Äúdirty list,‚Äù is not a penalty or fine but serves to publicly draw attention to companies that have been investigated and judged by labor inspection authorities for using forced labor. 
BYD will not be included on this list, as it was the contracting company. 
However, being on this list harms a company‚Äôs public reputation and leads to closer scrutiny by labor inspection authorities.
Both Jinjiang and BYD will be fined. The fine amounts are still being determined, and both the head of the prosecutor‚Äôs office and the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MTE) official stated they could not comment on the specific amount.

Relationship Between BYD and Jinjiang
BYD's CEO for the Americas, Stella Lee, warned BYD‚Äôs global headquarters in China that hiring Jinjiang would bring problems for BYD in Brazil due to labor issues. She did everything she could to prevent Jinjiang from coming to Brazil. 
It‚Äôs important to note that any executive with experience in the Brazilian market would know that hiring a company like Jinjiang would cause issues with local legislation. 
The person responsible for civil engineering at BYD in China is the nephew of the owner, and despite Lee‚Äôs opposition, he decided to hire Jinjiang anyway.
Because Lee strongly opposed the hiring of Jinjiang, she faced no consequences within BYD for the actions of the subcontractor.
